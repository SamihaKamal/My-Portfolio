        <h2>Nursery assistant</h2>
        <h3>Lewsey Childrens centre - July 2018</h3>
        <p>
            During year 10 I undertook work experience at the local nursery, at the time I did not know what
            sort of career path I would want and so tested out the options. The nursery was nice and it taught
            me alot on social skills and safety, caring for children is taxing and I had to be able to keep up
            with their energy and make sure they were safe as well.
            My duties consisted of playing with the children during the break times, helping them eat for lunch
            and also to play with them and keep them engaged regularly, when the day ended we had to clean up
            after the kids and make sure that everything was ready for the next day. I worked with different
            age groups and the responsibilities were different depending on which group I was with.
            <br>
            The experience taught me alot about responisibility and allowed me to be more confident in myself 
            as well since it was my first time in a working environment.
