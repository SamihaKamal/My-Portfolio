            My name is Samiha Kamal and im currently a third year software engineering student studying at 
            Queen Mary University of London. I love to draw and create and one of my pasttime is to knit, I
            have already created a scarf thats fluffy and perfect for the winter and am now currently creating
            a basket.
            Other than arts and crafts I also adore reading and have read many books ranging from published
            paperbacks to webnovels.

                I became interested in software engineering and computer science by chance during sixth form, I
                had to choose three options for my A levels and decided to pick computer science randomly, that
                was my introduction into this subject and I knew afterwards that this was a subject that I wanted
                to pursue in my future. Hence I took a software engineering degree.
