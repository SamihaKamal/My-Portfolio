                <h2>Computer science sixth form project</h2>
                <h3>To view images in larger format, please click on them</h3>
                <p>
                    For my computer science course at sixth form I was required to create an
                    application. For this I used Visual Studio's Windows Forms as it allowed
                    me to easily create programs with precreated items like buttons and list
                    boxes. My idea for this project was to create a study application that
                    focused on physics to help students learn the subjects better. The 
                    application would have many features such as flashcards, quizzes and a
                    login system to store the users data.
                </p>
                <p>Here are some of the screenshots from the program: </p>
                <a target="_blank" href="Portfolio/SBAP main menu.jpg">
                    <img src="Portfolio/SBAP main menu.jpg" width="300px" height="200px">
                </a>
                <p>The first image is of the main menu page, this is what the user will see 
                    after they log onto the application, the buttons all lead to different
                    features of the web application.
                </p>
                <a target="_blank" href="Portfolio/SBAP main paige.jpg">

                </a>
                <p>
                    The next image is of the main login/signup screen. The user enters their
                    credentials to create a new account for the study app and the data is 
                    stored externally. When the User enters their login details afterwards
                    the program would check the external spreadsheet and let the user in 
                    if all was well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can view the pdf of my full documentation for the computer science project
                    here:
                    <a href="Portfolio/ComputerScienceProject.pdf">Link to pdf</a>
                    The full documentation contains all parts of the working application, my initial 
                    goals and what I achieved later on, it also has the all the code written within
                    the appendix at the end.
                </p>
                <p>Honestly, this project was my first foray into large scale coding and projects
                    related to computer science. Developing this taught me alot about documentation
                    and the importance of setting your success criteria and goals. I learned alot 
                    about not overestimating my abilities and how to accept failure and how to work
                    around it.

            <section> <!--EPQ-->
                <h2>EPQ fitness application</h2>
                <p>
                    During my time at Luton sixth form I took part in doing an extended project
                    which would give me a grade and is generally thought of as half an A level.
                    When I thought of what I wanted to do for my EPQ I thought of developing 
                    another application similar to the Computer science project that I was doing 
                    at the time. Since I was finishing off the project and near the end I
                    believed that it would be fine to do something similar but in a smaller scale.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Inspiration struck me when I saw a close family member of mine exercising in
                    an effort to lose weight, I thought of creating an application to help with
                    losing weight. This was quite difficult than I originally planned it to be 
                    since I lacked knowledge on fitness and wellbeing. This meant I had to 
                    heavily research such topics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Like before I have attatched some images and annotations of my application:
                </p>
                <a target="_blank" href="Portfolio/EPQ calendar.jpg">
                    <img src="Portfolio/EPQ calendar.jpg" width="300px" height="200px">
                </a>
                <p>
                    The image above is of the calendar feature of the application. The 
                    calendar was quite difficult to implement and used programming 
                    concepts that I had not learned yet. Therefore, I used resources such as
                    Youtube videos to create this.
                </p>

                </a>
                <p>
                    This image is taken from the pdf that I will link below, It shows a few
                    sections of the program with some annotations.                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can view the pdf of my EPQ here:
                    <a href="Portfolio/EPQ.2.pdf">Link to pdf</a>
                    The full documentation contains all parts of the working application, my initial 
                    goals and what I achieved later on, it also has the all the code written within
                    the appendix at the end.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the EPQ I learned quite alot, such as to not take on projects without
                    proper research. Even though I looked through many articles on Fitness and 
                    wellbeing, I was still sorely inadequate in knowledge of this topic. This 
                    affected my work as creating some features became difficult like the diet advice 
                    section. I learned from this endeavor that research is integral to creating 
                    applications on topics that you dont know as much on.

            <section> <!--Semester 1 Miniproject-->
                <h2>Semester 1 pet game</h2>
                <p>
                    For my Semester 1 procedural programming module I was required to do a coding
                    project where I had to create a game using procedural programming style with
                    the coding language Java. For the project I was given a few options to create and 
                    the one I went with was a Pet game where the User takes care of a virtual pet,
                    similar to Tamagotchi. I was given levels where each level had set requirements
                    such as have input output for level 1 and lvel 8 would be to have file input and 
                    output.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have played many Pet games and am in love with the Tamagotchi series so I was 
                    pretty passionant about creating a pet program simulator. I had many ideas already
                    in my head that I wanted to implement. Unlike my other two projects that were done 
                    in Windows Forms, this mini project was created using jupyter hub and there were not
                    any buttons to push but the whole program worked like a console app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Below I have attatched screenshots of the working program and what the output looks like:
                </p>
                <a target="_blank" href="Portfolio/SEM1 mini project.png">

                </a>
                <p>
                    Both screenshots are taken in different parts of the gameplay, the first is the intoduction
                    The user can load a save slot or they can create a new account by entering their name and
                    choosing a pet. The final screenshot has the ending of the game, where the user chooses
                    to log out and a goodbye message is printed out. To reach requirements needed the game 
                    had many elements such as a shopping system and a system to feed your pet. Below I have
                    attatched the pdf of the final version of my mini project with testing, the full code and
                    the full working program example. 
                    <a href="Portfolio/MiniProjectLvl8.pdf">Link to pdf</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have learnt from this miniproject that sometimes meeting requirements means that you have
                    to let go of features that you want and that striving to achieve the specification means that
                    sometimes you will have to code parts of a program that you may not want, but must have. This
                    was never a problem for my EPQ and Sixth form project because I was the one that made the spec
                    and I was the one that chose what I wanted for the success criteria to be realised. Taking on
                    this project helped me develop an understanding that its important to prioritise whats 
                    important than going off and doing things that arent required. Time limitations and deadlines
                    means that you have to disregard extra ideas and codes that are not part of the original 
                    specifications.

                <h2>Working with MIPS</h2>
                <p>
                    During my first semester and Queen Mary I took a module called Computer Systems and Networks. In 
                    this module I was required to create few programs using the assembly language MIPS. This proved
                    to be extremely difficult as I was not proficient in assembly and the concept was foreign to me. 
                    Furthermore, I didnt really understand it when it was taught during lectures. Therefore, I was 
                    extremely pleased when I managed to attain full marks. There were 5 tasks I was required to 
                    complete and I only managed 4, however there were bonus marks avaialble so not completing the
                    5th task didnt make me lose any marks. Some of these tasks were to capitalise all letters of a
                    string or to add together numbers of the multiples of 8.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Below I have attatched screenshots of some of the programs that I created:
                </p>
                <a target="_blank" href="Portfolio/MIPS q2.png">
                    <img src="Portfolio/MIPS q2.png" width="300px" height="200px">
                </a>
                <p>
                    This screenshot was for my question 2 and it was by far the most difficult task I have had to
                    complete. This task required me to remove all words that started with a lowercase letter. For
                    me it took me 27 drafts before I managed to get a final product that worked. This was extremely
                    different than the other questions which took a maximum of 10, sometimes 2 or 3. I would sometimes
                    have an issue that only the lowercase were deleted, or both lowercase and numbers were deleted, or 
                    the program would crash or go into an infinite loop. Therefore, the joy I had when I completed This
                    was wonderful.
                </p>
                <a target="_blank" href="Portfolio/MIPS q4.png">
                    <img src="Portfolio/MIPS q4.png" width="300px" height="200px">
                </a>
                
                <p>
                    This screenshot was of question 4, I believe that I was required to add all numbers that were 
                    multiples of 8 regardless of whether they were positive or negative and then output the final result.
                    I quite enjoyed doing this as it contrasted the hell that was coding question 2 with something more 
                    simpler.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The MIPS coursework taught me alot of things and one of those was perseverance. I never gave up on 
                    making question 2 working and in the end I was rewarded for my efforts. I think this was an important
                    lesson to learn that regardless of what you are working on you should not give up.

                <h2>Pet sitter and pet owner social media</h2>
                <p>During my second year I was in a group with 4 other people and we had to create an application, there was 
                a choice between various options and we selected a pet sitter application. The process on working on the 
                application was to analyse the domain and find the requirements before planning and designing the app before 
                finally building a prototype. Since we only had one semester to do all of this we only had enough time to create
                one prototype.</p>
                <p>Below are photos of what the final product looked like: </p>

                <p>In order to develop the application more efficiently, me and my teammates created a github repository in 
                    order to work on the project and collaborate together. This project taught me alot about how to work in github 
                    about branches and merging as well as basic operations of github. This knowledge is what I am using to create 
                    this website as well.
